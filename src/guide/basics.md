# vinv-Basics

vinv-Basics are technically identical to "full-fledged" schemas.
However, they are characterized by the fact that they only make sense in connection with other values.

::: info
The information of a [Location](/basics/location/0.0.1/dereferenced.md) is only useful if it is in context to, for example, a [Individual-Tree](/specifications/vinv-individual-tree/overview.md) or a person.
:::

Since basics alone do not make sense, they can and should be integrated into full-fledged schemas if necessary.
